### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
Hello 

user story
As a person wanting to drink some cocktails,
I want to select ingredients and then have recommendations appear
So that I can prepare a drink or receive the best recommendations
Given some ingredients
When I selected some ingredients
Then I see available options
When I fill in the input field and press the search button
Then I will see a list of 5 drinks to choose from
When I press search button without any inputs in the input field
Then I will be re-directed to the full list of drinks at the bottom of the webpage.
When I navigate the the bottom of the page and selected a checkbox beside a specific alcohol
Then only drinks with that specific alcohol will remain visible
